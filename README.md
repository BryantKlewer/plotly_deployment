# Plotly_Deployment

## Overview
* Improbable Beef is trying to find the correct bacteria in order to develop a lab grown beef alternative. They have compiled a large data set of belly button bacteria to help them with their project. I was tasked with creating a [dashboard](https://bryantklewer.github.io/plotly_deployment/) for this to allow the test subjects to see if the winning bacteria was found in their belly button!

## Dashboard
* View of the dashboard landing page. Click the link to see the [dashboard](https://bryantklewer.github.io/plotly_deployment/).

* To the left of the dashboard, the user can select their "Test Subject ID No." which will populate the belly button bacteria data as well as their demographic information. 
* ![test_subject_data](https://github.com/BryantKlewer/plotly_deployment/blob/main/Screen_Shots/test_subject_data.png)

* The dashboard has three charts showing the top 10 bacterias found in the subject's belly button, how many times per week the user washes their belly button, and all bacteria found in the test subjects belly button. 
* Bar chart showing the top 10 types of bacteria found.
* ![top_cultures_found](https://github.com/BryantKlewer/plotly_deployment/blob/main/Screen_Shots/top_cultures_found.png)
* Gauge chart showing number of washes per week.

* Bubble chart showing all varieties of bacteria in the test subjects belly button. 
* ![culture_samples](https://github.com/BryantKlewer/plotly_deployment/blob/main/Screen_Shots/culture_samples.png)
* The bacteria charts are interactive as well! Scrolling over the bacteria data populates the bacterial information.
