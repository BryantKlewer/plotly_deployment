# Plotly_Deployment

## Overview
* Improbable Beef is trying to find the correct bacteria in order to develop a lab grown beef alternative. They have compiled a large data set of belly button bacteria to help them with their project. I was tasked with creating a [dashboard](https://bryantklewer.github.io/plotly_deployment/) for this to allow the test subjects to see if the winning bacteria was found in their belly button!

## Dashboard
* View of the dashboard landing page. Link to the [dashboard](https://bryantklewer.github.io/plotly_deployment/).

* To the left of the dashboard, the user can select their "Test Subject ID No." which will populate the belly button bacteria data as well as their demographic information. ![test_subject_data](https://github.com/BryantKlewer/plotly_deployment/blob/main/Screen_Shots/test_subject_data.png)
